        <p><b>Rick Astley</b> is a British singer and songwriter whose name became synonymous with one of the internet's most iconic memes.<br>
          But long before the digital fame, he was a pop sensation with a voice that surprised the world.<br>
          Born on February 6, 1966, in Lancashire, England, Rick Astley shot to fame in 1987 with his debut single,<br>
          “Never Gonna Give You Up.” The track became a global hit, reaching #1 in 25 countries and making Rick an overnight star.<br>
          His deep, soulful voice was an unexpected contrast to his youthful, clean-cut look — and that contrast became part of his appeal.
